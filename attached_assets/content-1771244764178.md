## Powerful Features

🖥️

### Device Management

Powerful device cleanup operations with enterprise-grade safety controls. Perform delete, retire, and wipe actions on non-compliant Intune-managed devices while protecting your critical infrastructure.

- **Advanced Filtering:** Filter by compliance state, OS type, owner type, and last sync age
- **30-Day Safety Guard:** Automatically prevents deletion of devices synced within the last 30 days
- **Dry-Run Preview:** See exactly what will happen before executing any destructive action
- **Hybrid Protection:** Automatically excludes hybrid-joined devices from removal operations
- **Three Actions:** Delete (remove from Intune), Retire (remove company data), or Wipe (factory reset)
- **Bulk Operations:** Process multiple devices efficiently with real-time progress tracking

📁

### Group Management

Streamline Entra ID group cleanup and organization with intelligent search capabilities and bulk operations. Perfect for maintaining a clean tenant after migrations or reorganizations.

- **Find Empty Groups:** Instantly locate all groups with zero members to clean up unused groups
- **Pattern Matching:** Three search modes - Regex (advanced patterns), Contains (partial match), and Starts With (prefix match)
- **Bulk Rename:** Rename multiple groups at once with search/replace functionality and live preview
- **30-Day Recovery:** Deleted groups remain in Entra ID recycle bin for 30 days, allowing easy restoration if needed
- **Group Details:** View member count, group types, and sync status at a glance
- **Safe Deletion:** Remove multiple groups simultaneously with confirmation dialogs

📊

### Real-time Logging

Professional terminal-style log viewer provides complete transparency into every operation. See exactly what the tool is doing with color-coded, auto-updating logs showing all Microsoft Graph API calls and responses.

- **Live Updates:** Watch operations progress in real-time with auto-scrolling terminal output
- **Color-Coded Output:** Cyan for info, Yellow for API calls, Green for success, Red for errors, Gray for summaries
- **Full API Transparency:** Every Graph API call is logged with exact cmdlet names and parameters
- **Device ID Mapping:** Shows both Intune Device ID and Entra Object ID for complete traceability
- **Operation Summaries:** Detailed success/failure counts after each bulk operation
- **Export Capability:** Export device and group lists to CSV for reporting and documentation

🔒

### Security & Safety

Enterprise-grade safety mechanisms prevent accidental data loss. Multiple confirmation layers and intelligent safeguards ensure you maintain full control over destructive operations.

- **Case-Sensitive Confirmations:** Must type exact confirmation text (case-sensitive) to proceed with deletions
- **3-Attempt Retry Logic:** Three chances to enter correct confirmation before operation cancels
- **Mandatory Dry-Run:** Preview-only mode is always enabled by default for device operations
- **Hybrid-Joined Protection:** Hybrid Azure AD joined devices are automatically excluded and never removed
- **Entra ID Integration:** Uses Microsoft Graph with proper permissions - no direct database access
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive try-catch blocks with detailed error messages for troubleshooting

[Download Logo (.png)](https://intunestuff.tools/images/IntuneStuffLogo.png)

You can replace this with your own company logo for branding

**💡 Branding Tip:** Replace `IntuneStuffLogo.png` with your own company logo! Just save your logo with the same filename and place it in the same folder as the script.

## Quick Start Guide

1

### System Requirements

- Windows 10/11 or Windows Server 2016+
- PowerShell 7+
- .NET Framework 4.7.2+

2

### Download Files

Download the PowerShell script and optionally download the logo (or use your own):

- `IntuneEntraManagementTool.ps1` (required)
- `IntuneStuffLogo.png` or your company logo (optional)

_Both files should be in the same folder._

3

### Install Visual Studio Code (Recommended)

**⚠️ Important:** For the best experience, we recommend using **Visual Studio Code** instead of native PowerShell. VSCode provides better error messages, integrated terminal, and debugging capabilities.

[📥 Download VS Code (Free)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

_After installing VSCode, install the **PowerShell extension** from the Extensions marketplace._

4

### Set Execution Policy

Open PowerShell 7 (or VSCode terminal) as Administrator and run:

`Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`

5

### Run the Tool

**Using VSCode (Recommended):**

1. Open the folder containing `IntuneEntraManagementTool.ps1` in VSCode
2. Right-click the file and select "Run with PowerShell"
3. Or press **F5** to run with debugging enabled

**Using Native PowerShell:**

Right-click on `IntuneEntraManagementTool.ps1` and select "Run with PowerShell"

💡 The tool will automatically install required modules on first run (3-5 minutes).

### 🔧 Installation Process

**When does installation happen?**

The first time you run IntuneStuff, it checks if these modules are already installed on your system. If they're missing, it automatically installs them from the official PowerShell Gallery.

**Installation Location:**

Modules are installed to your user profile using `-Scope CurrentUser`, so Administrator privileges are not required for module installation.

**Time Required:**

First run: 3-5 minutes to download and install all modules

Subsequent runs: Instant (modules are already installed)

**Can I pre-install them myself?**

Yes! If you prefer to install the modules manually before running the tool, open PowerShell and run:

`Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Authentication, Microsoft.Graph.DeviceManagement, Microsoft.Graph.DeviceManagement.Actions, Microsoft.Graph.Identity.DirectoryManagement -Scope CurrentUser`

**🔒 Security Note:** All modules are official Microsoft packages downloaded from the trusted PowerShell Gallery repository. IntuneStuff does not install any third-party or custom modules.

## Required Permissions

IntuneStuff uses Microsoft Graph API. On first connection, you'll be prompted to grant these permissions:

#### Device Management

- `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.ReadWrite.All`
- `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.PrivilegedOperations.All`

#### Entra ID Devices

- `Device.ReadWrite.All`

#### Group Management

- `Group.ReadWrite.All`
- `GroupMember.Read.All`

✅ Simply click "Accept" in the consent dialog when prompted. This is a one-time setup per tenant.
